            <p>Programming Contest are not very different to Capture the Flag, as you know a CTF is a special kind of information security competitions where categories can be Web, Forensics, Crypto, Binary, or something else, The main Idea  is solve challenges, meanwhile Programming Contest is the same but here I can notice clearly an academic approach which includes mathematics , physics, statistics, data structures, and other topics that maybe I don't know yet, This entrance is to express How I feel in my first Programming Contest sponsored by RPC (). </p>

<p>As always I was late at the event, starting at 1 p.m of 28 day of November, Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira was the host of this competition, the idea of me participating in this contest was to know more about how it is,What kind of problems I need to face in the future, and the most important if it's funny because if you don't like this just quit out. </p>

<p>My team was conformed by two  more people Leiver a fellow class of the operations research and a new friend that certainly looked pretty smart Sebastian, both of them have a lot of experience in this kind of competitions, is obviously that a team is a conformation to speak also It was to generate synergy, new ideas, discuss problems, and share knowledge in how to solve this or that problem, but that did not happen here apparently I do not know many issues, nor have methods in mind I just could think myself in the problems and maybe share my thoughts, because that was the only thing that happened. To me this experiment was interesting because I'm confident with myself that I need to learn much more, and  increase my expertise in Computer programming, of course there is a goal behind this,and it needs to be part of my personal toolkit as a hacker. </p>

<p>Things that I learn : </p>

<p>If you're going to use c++ you can use this trick, </p>

<p>There is no need to include any other header files here and it's interesting because in stack overflow there is a question related to this : <br>
