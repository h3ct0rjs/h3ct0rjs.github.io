<blockquote>
  <p> Hacking is, in its very essence, an underground movement. Those who take part on it have always been the ones who (ab)used technology in ways beyond the knowledge of the larger userbase. It is tightly linked to intense efforts in unveiling previously unknown information as well as in sharing these discoveries. These premises hold true for as long as we know hackers: since computers had barely no users up until the informatic massification of today. The nature of the hacker interests intrinsically poses difficulties: <strong><em>growing knowledge on anything is hard. It requires heavy research, experimentation, and can turn into an endless journey if objectives are not carefully set. Just like in any field of scientific studies, it calls for a good amount of colaboration, an attitude which, luckily for hackers, was greatly enabled by the advent of computer networks and, most notably, the Internet.</em></strong> Computer networks increasingly made it possible to transmit<em>* _unlimited and uncensored information across their geographical extent with little effort_<strong>, with little costs, and in virtually no time. From the communication development standpoint, one would expect that the events that followed the 80s to our days would lead to a geometric progression in the number of hacker communities. In effect, hacking has arguably grown. *</strong></em>Hacker communities, definitely not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just take a moment , and think on this wise words of wisdom. <br>
