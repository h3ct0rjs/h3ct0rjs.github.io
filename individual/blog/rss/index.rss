Sometimes is when you edit a file inside  /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/file.conf and maybe your edition just didn't accomplish with the syntax so here  is how can you check : &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Make sure that your Apache2 service is up and running. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="brush:bash"&gt;user@~$sudo service apache2 status  
● apache2.service - LSB: Apache2 web server 

Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/apache2; bad; vendor preset: enabled) 

Active: active (running) since Fri 2016-01-29 14:05:16 EST; 14s ago 

Docs: man:systemd-sysv-generator(8) 

Process: 31573 ExecStop=/etc/init.d/apache2 stop (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS) 

Process: 17063 ExecReload=/etc/init.d/apache2 reload (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS) 

Process: 30948 ExecStart=/etc/init.d/apache2 start (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)  

... 
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this isn't the output, read carefully the error. &lt;br&gt;
2. Check your &lt;strong&gt;systemctl status&lt;/strong&gt;, this will give you a lot of information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="brush:bash"&gt;user@~$sudo systemctl status apache2.service  
● apache2.service - LSB: Apache2 web server 

Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/apache2; bad; vendor preset: enabled) 

Active: failed (Result: exit-code) since Fri 2016-01-29 13:48:57 EST; 18s ago 

Docs: man:systemd-sysv-generator(8) 

Process: 31573 ExecStop=/etc/init.d/apache2 stop (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS) 

Process: 17063 ExecReload=/etc/init.d/apache2 reload (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS) 

Process: 30467 ExecStart=/etc/init.d/apache2 start (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)  
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Run the &lt;strong&gt;apache config test&lt;/strong&gt;. It is always a good idea to run &lt;strong&gt;configtest&lt;/strong&gt; everytime you make changes to the apache2 config file so that you won't accidentally stop apache2 service &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="brush:bash"&gt;user@~$ sudo apache2ctl configtest  
AH00558: apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1\. Set the 'ServerName' directive globally to suppress this message  
Syntax OK  
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. Restart the apache service &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="brush:bash"&gt;user@~$ sudo service apache2 stop &amp;&amp; sudo service apache2 start  
&lt;/pre&gt;

As you know the most recent security conference was  the Usenix enigma as it's commonly in this kind of Cons there was a Capture The Flag , The EFF was runing a hacking contest at Enigma!  The challenges included web hacking, binary analysis, cryptography challenges, and more. &lt;br&gt;

I doubt it, I've seen a lot of  systems over the time and wherever I've been, security invariably sucks even in the places where they really know it does suck. So, it's not a non sequitir to state that they'd probably be more secure with someone else handling the data at rest part of the equation or data in transit within the cloud provider. &lt;/p&gt;

So this blog post is not going to be about computer security or relate it, it's my invitation to you to read and article written by me and my fellow Sebastian Zapata this was and assignment in the communication techniques class meet the following requirements :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read and use the arguments of  the textbook 'Redacción Técnica '  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write an article based on the image below, and release the article under Open Science movement [1]  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use  the American Psychological Association rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Fig.2 Work done, Ascendent order&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will find this article in tex and pdf format in the next link :&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://goo.gl/9EZdTk"&gt;Articulo de Técnicas Comunicación&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;[Full Text in Spanish] &lt;br&gt;
See you next[1]: &lt;em&gt;Open science is the movement to make scientific research, data and dissemination accessible to all levels of an inquiring society, amateur or professional. _&lt;/em&gt;It encompasses practices such as publishing open research, campaigning for open access, encouraging scientists to practice open notebook science, and generally making it easier to publish and communicate scientific knowledge_ &lt;br&gt;
UPDATE:Due to this research , I've had problems with some professors and teachers they claim that I'm evil and a destroyer for reveal potential risks to the public, meanwhile I don't think about this as a problem because it exist inside the campus and  that's happening in other national campus around Colombia, This shows how bad prepared are the professionals who manages network of the university, without generalizing of course. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always I was late at the event, starting at 1 p.m of 28 day of November, Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira was the host of this competition, the idea of me participating in this contest was to know more about how it is,What kind of problems I need to face in the future, and the most important if it's funny because if you don't like this just quit out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My team was conformed by two  more people Leiver a fellow class of the operations research and a new friend that certainly looked pretty smart Sebastian, both of them have a lot of experience in this kind of competitions, is obviously that a team is a conformation to speak also It was to generate synergy, new ideas, discuss problems, and share knowledge in how to solve this or that problem, but that did not happen here apparently I do not know many issues, nor have methods in mind I just could think myself in the problems and maybe share my thoughts, because that was the only thing that happened. To me this experiment was interesting because I'm confident with myself that I need to learn much more, and  increase my expertise in Computer programming, of course there is a goal behind this,and it needs to be part of my personal toolkit as a hacker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things that I learn : &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're going to use c++ you can use this trick, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="brush:bash"&gt;#include &lt;bits stdc++.h=""&gt;&lt;/bits&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no need to include any other header files here and it's interesting because in stack overflow there is a question related to this : &lt;br&gt;

At a time when leading computer scientists are debating whether the Internet is so broken that it needs to be replaced, the network is expanding faster than ever, layering flaw upon flaw in an ever-expanding web of insecurity. Perhaps the best hope for fixing this, some experts argue, lies in changing the operating system that — more than any other — controls these machines.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kernel Security is pretty important right now and if you don't believe in that check the statistics in android's phone usage, also you can take a quick Look at a few recent kernel security holes that has Buffer Overflows, initialization failures and the list goes on. The point is that been Torvalds the king of geeks he is obviously going to be the king of the bad guys if they don't review properly commits and new patches, security is above usability or I think so, that's why Security of Linux even as it became a bigger is more important, but seriously Torvalds just said that People in security is just too paranoid.I remember when  long time ago Linux in its early days was widely considered a safer choice than Windows or other commercial operating systems, but now it has been disappear slowly. I have to say that not all problems did not involve the kernel itself, but they're there, and it's becoming a popular target for hackers building “botnets,” and the companies that sell them surveillance tools like . &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could be The Kernel Security taking as a relevant topic ? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Knowing how to code is mostly about building things, and the path is a lot clearer when you have a sense of the end goal. If your goal is “learn to code,” without a clear idea of the kinds of programs you will write and how they will make your life better, you will probably find it a frustrating exercise. 
  I’m a little ashamed to admit that part of my motivation for studying computer science was that I wanted to prove I was smart, and I wanted to be able to get Smart Person jobs. I also liked thinking about math and theory ( blew my mind at an impressionable age) and the program was a good fit. It wasn’t enough to sustain me for long, though, until I found ways to connect technology to the things I really loved, like music and literature.

Trying to get more information about Colombian's ip assignments we know that internet is a big number of connections between different AS, ASs are generally Internet service providers but can also be large companies, universities, and other such organizations who act as independent entities on the Internet. These AS's are responsible for &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;assigning individual IP addresses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and routing traffic from individual machines out to and in from the wider Internet, So we want to get more information about the Ipv4 assignments and the best way to get this is going to the primary source for IP address data and it's the regional Internet registries which allocate and distribute IP addresses through organizations located in their respective service regions, This regions are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;African Network Information Centre (AfriNIC)  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;American Registry for Internet Numbers(ARIN)  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre (APNIC)  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latin American and Caribbean Internet Address Registry (LACNIC)  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RIPE Network Coordination Centre (RIPE NCC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Regional_Internet_Registries_world_map.svg/800px-Regional_Internet_Registries_world_map.svg.png" alt="" title="Internet Registries"&gt; 
According to wikipedia the main aims are to : &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protect the unallocated IP number resource pool,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Promote and protect the bottom-up policy development process of the Internet, and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Act as a focal point for Internet community input into the RIf system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every Regional Internet registry has it's own ftp service sharing information related to the assignments [5] and also a mirror of the other RI'r. &lt;br&gt;
As it's shown in the picture you can see all the content inside the /pub (public folder)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TtmFgJrIfDA/VUVrHnEdskI/AAAAAAAAAjI/bOAD7WrQrVI/s1600/url.png)&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Checking all the directory structure, assignments are in /pub/stats/region&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case I'm interest in all the IP addressing assignments by Lacnic and specifically my country Colombia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just get &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;delegated-lacnic-extended-latest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;delegated-lacnic-extended-latest.md5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; files wich are that contains all the information That we  need to play with, also notice the update history and the date in the ftp. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iglgMv4pX48/VUVw0Gnn1JI/AAAAAAAAAjY/oXObuavc694/s1600/get.png)&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Getting files to play with&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So these files contains all the Latinamerican assignments including the next countries: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VJascv6q4TA/VUV0_yEMZ-I/AAAAAAAAAjk/lTFhqnyNmUs/s1600/co.png" alt="" title=""&gt;You can get this result running a simple filter and cat I like the bash way so here it is : &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="brush:bash"&gt;cat delegated-lacnic-extended-latest|cut -d '|' -f  2|sort |uniq &gt;country  
cat country &lt;/pre&gt;

**_Grepping by Country:_** 
Now to get the information in what we're interests we need to filter our file by country and IPv4 the file itself has a 8 column format as is explained above: 

Column 1:Regional Internet registry (Lacnic in this case)  
Column 2:Country Code (CO)  
Column 3:Ip Class,Type Resource (ASN,IPV4,IPV6)  
Column 4:Network Begin  
Column 5:Ip Address Quantity  
Column 6:Assignment Date.  
Column 7:Organization Type  
Column 8: unknow for me. 

&gt; cat delegated-lacnic-extended-latest | grep -i "CO|IPV4"

and after that we get something like this : 

&lt;pre class="brush:python"&gt;lacnic|CO|ipv4|66.231.64.0|4096|19870101|allocated|75710  
lacnic|CO|ipv4|131.0.136.0|1024|20140711|allocated|220116  
lacnic|CO|ipv4|131.0.168.0|1024|20140714|allocated|218493  
lacnic|CO|ipv4|131.108.168.0|1024|20140902|allocated|30093  
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can get 375 entries but how many ipv4 addresses are assigned to CO in total? &lt;br&gt;
off course this could be done filtering the 5 column and the IP to ASN Mapping Project &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Team Cymru provides a number of query interfaces that allow for the mapping of IP addresses to BGP prefixes and Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs), based on BGP feeds from our 50+ BGP peers, and updated every 4 hours. This data is available through traditional WHOIS (TCP 43), DNS (UDP 53), HTTP (TCP 80), and HTTPS (TCP 443). For more information on the data available, and how to query, check out our IP to ASN Mapping Project.dding line per line in order to get the total number. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;$ \sum _{ i=0 }^{ 375 }{eachlinei }$&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="brush:bash"&gt;cat Colombia.txt |cut -d '|' -f5 |awk '{s+=$1} END {printf "%.0f", s}' 

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17.263.593 in IPv4 assignments to Colombian Country until the last update of file.&lt;/strong&gt; 
In this amount of IPv4 Addresses we will be pretty interest in entities that don't waste  time and money searching for you generally this type of entities are non-goverment such as universities, public schools but always without goverment asociation.Offcourse we can use a service to query for some basic AS information directly and for this I'm going to use the Team Cymru's nslookup. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.team-cymru.org/IP-ASN-mapping.html"&gt;The IP to ASN Mapping Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow the steps given in the official website, using netcat is a better way to get this information, you can filter out the ips addresses using the next : &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="brush:bash"&gt;grep  -i 'ipv4\|ipv6' Colombia.txt|cut -d '|' -f4 &gt;ipsColombia.txt&lt;/pre&gt;

Maybe the previous won't work because you need to map an IPv6 address or prefix to a corresponding BGP Origin ASN.if you just want the ipv4 version : 

&lt;pre class="brush:bash"&gt;grep  -i 'ipv4' Colombia.txt|cut -d '|' -f4 &gt;ipsColombia.txt  
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then add the begin and end word to the file. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="brush:bash"&gt;netcat whois.cymru.com 43 &lt; ipsColombia.txt | sort -n &gt; asninfo.txt #ipv4, and ipv6  
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-d2kT-7UbwdI/VUjO48B8MCI/AAAAAAAAAkE/pIDBwkqBEPo/s1600/asinfo.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-d2kT-7UbwdI/VUjO48B8MCI/AAAAAAAAAkE/pIDBwkqBEPo/s400/asinfo.png" alt="" title=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;I hope that this information could be useful , cheers&lt;/em&gt;

According to  the book "_Inside Cyber Warfare"  _This is an increasing field that has been taken as part of the patrimony of all nations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a growing awareness of the vulnerability of a nation’s critical infrastructure to 
  network attack. Transportation, banking, telecommunications, and energy are among 
  the most vulnerable systems and may be subject to the following modes of attack: 
  • Insider threats 
  • Anonymous access to protected networks via the Internet and Supervisory Control 
  and Data Acquisition (SCADA) 
  • Counterfeit hardware 
  • Employee abuse of security guidelines leading to malware propagation inside the 
  firewall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what would it happend if your country is under one cyber attack? What Would you do ?, here  is something that you could do assuming that everything is connected (knowing that this is happening right now with the Internet of Things concept ). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep this things : &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A battery-powered radio capable of receiving NOAA alerts and two-way radios (walkie-talkies)  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;solar-powered or hand-cranked radio as well  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cash reserve should be kept within reach  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social Security cards and other essential documents should also be held in a secure container,since access to a computer won’t be guaranteed  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare a central point to speak with your family members take out power lines and cell phone towers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online safety tips &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Limit the amount of personal information you post on social media sites, chat sites, forums and online games. 
• Know and use privacy settings provided on sites like Facebook and Twitter. 
• Be suspicious of unknown links or requests sent through email or text messages. Don’t click on unknown links or answer strange questions sent to your mobile device, regardless of who the sender appears to be. 
• In your email, turn off the option to automatically download attachments. Save and scan any attachments before opening them. 
• Verify the authenticity of requests from companies or individuals by contacting them directly, especially if you are being asked to provide personal information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Pay close attention to website URLs. Malicious websites sometimes use a variation in common spelling (petfun.com instead of petfun.net, for example) to deceive unsuspecting computer users.
