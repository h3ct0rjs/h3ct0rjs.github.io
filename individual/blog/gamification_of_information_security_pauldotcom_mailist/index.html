<p><strong>Gamification has been the buzz for the past few years. Game design concepts are appearing in everyday interactions like education, physical fitness/wellness, automotive design and even personal finances [and]. I am thinking about ways to use gameplay mechanics to reward employees for completing otherwise mundane tasks. I want to unlock that achievement "Making Work Fun".</strong> </p>

<p>**Typical gaming techniques include: </p>

<p>achievement "badges" </p>

<p>achievement levels </p>

<p>"leader boards" </p>

<p>a progress bar or other visual meter to indicate how close people are to completing a task a company is trying to encourage, such as completing a social networking profile or earning a frequent shopper loyalty award. </p>

<p>virtual currency </p>

<p>systems for awarding, redeeming, trading, gifting, and otherwise exchanging points </p>

<p>challenges between users </p>

<p>embedding small casual games within other activities </p>

<p>There are hacker challenges and competitions that encourage youth into the field of information security (or used as a recruiting ground by government agencies or companies) </p>

<p>What could day-to-day gamification of Information Security in the workplace look like? I want to brainstorm a few ideas first without thinking about the specific implementation (as this may put constraints or limits on the mechanics of the awards). </p>

<p>For example, awards could be something like: </p>

<p>"Security First": # of days without violating security policy or acceptable use (30 days, 90 days, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years) </p>

<p>"Security Smarts": # of hours of security awareness training completed (users could also get credits for reading security bulletins). </p>

<p>"Security Star": based on the score an employee receives on security awareness quiz (bronze: &gt;80%, silver: &gt;90%, gold: 100%) </p>

<p>"Strong Passwords": employee uses strong passwords </p>

<p>"Memory Like an Elephant" - # days without a password reset (30 days, 90 days, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years) </p>

<p>"Security Points": some form of currency or experience points for completing security related tasks or activities </p>

<p>For IT staff there are other things I can think of regarding service management, system management, patch management, change management and risk management (this can apply to most employees). </p>

<p>Maybe these are tracked and displayed individually or as a department to foster friendly competition and encourage better security practices. Maybe these are used as part of an annual performance review. </p>

<p>Basically, informatio security departments tends to get a bad reputation because they are the stick enforcing security policies. I'm trying to think of ways to be the carrot. I would rather provide a wall of fame for the superstars rather than a wall of shame (though I remember in one organization we had a giant screw mounted on a piece of wood... "screw up award"... it was the hot potato... we were always quick to pass it along to the next deserving coworker). </p>

<p>Any examples of gamification you've experienced in the workplace? Or, can you think of any ways to gamify information security? </p>
