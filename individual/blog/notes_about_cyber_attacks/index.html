            <p>In this post I'd like to share with you  some  interesting notes that I've been collecting for a while, about cyberattacks and other cyber'<strong>put your word here lol</strong>' that we hear everyday in the news and maybe knowing that all the journalist and press in general are always doing mistakes in the usage of the words. <br>
According to  the book "_Inside Cyber Warfare"  _This is an increasing field that has been taken as part of the patrimony of all nations. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>There is a growing awareness of the vulnerability of a nation’s critical infrastructure to 
  network attack. Transportation, banking, telecommunications, and energy are among 
  the most vulnerable systems and may be subject to the following modes of attack: 
  • Insider threats 
  • Anonymous access to protected networks via the Internet and Supervisory Control 
  and Data Acquisition (SCADA) 
  • Counterfeit hardware 
  • Employee abuse of security guidelines leading to malware propagation inside the 
  firewall</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what would it happend if your country is under one cyber attack? What Would you do ?, here  is something that you could do assuming that everything is connected (knowing that this is happening right now with the Internet of Things concept ). </p>

<p>Keep this things : </p>

<ol>
<li>A battery-powered radio capable of receiving NOAA alerts and two-way radios (walkie-talkies)  </li>
<li>solar-powered or hand-cranked radio as well  </li>
<li>Cash reserve should be kept within reach  </li>
<li>Social Security cards and other essential documents should also be held in a secure container,since access to a computer won’t be guaranteed  </li>
<li>Prepare a central point to speak with your family members take out power lines and cell phone towers</li>
</ol>

<p>Online safety tips </p>

<p>• Limit the amount of personal information you post on social media sites, chat sites, forums and online games. 
• Know and use privacy settings provided on sites like Facebook and Twitter. 
• Be suspicious of unknown links or requests sent through email or text messages. Don’t click on unknown links or answer strange questions sent to your mobile device, regardless of who the sender appears to be. 
• In your email, turn off the option to automatically download attachments. Save and scan any attachments before opening them. 
• Verify the authenticity of requests from companies or individuals by contacting them directly, especially if you are being asked to provide personal information. </p>

<p>• Pay close attention to website URLs. Malicious websites sometimes use a variation in common spelling (petfun.com instead of petfun.net, for example) to deceive unsuspecting computer users.
